                        <p>We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, Graceville and Westlake.</p>
                        <p>ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength
                            believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight
                            loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or just looking and feeling better - we're here for you!</p>
                        <p>ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group fitness classes and one-on-one personal training sessions for weight loss,
                            circuit training, boxing and karate. Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to none - all have Bachelor Degrees
                            in Human Movements.</p>
                        <p>We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying
                            telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way
                            more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up.  You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own
                            pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on
                            being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.</p>
                        <p>We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school
                            feel with a new school attitude!</p>
                        <p>We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends &amp; public holidays. <strong>WE ARE OPEN!</strong> Unlike other so
                            called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we
                            are open for you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our clubs.</p>

                            <img src="./images/staff-owner.jpg" alt="male owner training young woman boxing">
                            <p>Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my knowledge
                                and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump into the ring as your sparring partner.</p>
                            <p>For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene. He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now shares his
                                knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing classes with passion and enthusiasm.</p>
                            <p>The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly energised.</p>
                            <p>Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level boxer, you will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the best
                                cardiovascular workouts available.</p>
                            <p>But in order that you may see whence all this error is born of those who accuse pleasure and praise pain, I will open the whole matter and
                                explain what was said by that discoverer of truth and, as it were, the architect of a happy life. For no one abhors or hates or flees from
                                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because great pains follow those who do not know how to follow pleasure with reason.</p>
